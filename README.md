## CodeForces Scrapper
### A simple scrapper to collect data from codeforces API and analysing it.

### Folder discription:
- src: 
    - It contains the source codes.
- data:
    - It contains the dataset files

### Conclusions:
- Most of the questions are of type "implementation", "math", "dynamic programming" and "data structires"
- The most solved questions are of level A.
- The most solved question topic is "Implementation" then "math" then "greedy". Despite the number of question of topic "dynamic programming" is high, the number of people solved the questions are less. More number of people solved "Greedy" problems than "dynamic programming. This shows "dynamic programming problems are `hard` to solve.
